----------

This is a guide to transcribing the different English accents using the Arpabet
phoneme set used by the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary and other resources.

The vowel transcriptions use a classification system based on John Wells' Lexical
Sets<sup>\[<a href="#ref1">1</a>\]</sup>. These were created by Wells in 1982
by comparing the Received Pronunciation British (RP) and General American
(GenAm) accents in use at that time.

Where lexical sets have been merged in an accent you are transcribing but not
in one of the accents listed here, the transcription of the lexical set the two
have merged into should be used. For example, with a `NORTH-FORCE` merger, the
transcription for `NORTH` should be used, not the `FORCE` transcription.

## Short Vowels

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| KIT         | `IH`   | `IH`   |
| DRESS       | `EH`   | `EH`   |
| TRAP        | `AE`   | `AE`   |
| LOT         | `OH`   | `AA`   |
| STRUT       | `AH`   | `AH`   |
| FOOT        | `UH`   | `UH`   |

## Long Vowels

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| FLEECE      | `IY`   | `IY`   |
| PALM        | `AA`   | `AA`   |
| THOUGHT     | `AO`   | `AO`   |
| GOOSE       | `UW`   | `UW`   |

## Rhotic Vowels

These are vowels that are followed by an `r` that is not part of the next syllable
when considering the root form of the word containing that vowel.

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| NURSE       | `ER`   | `ER`   |
| START       | `AA`   | `AA R` |
| NORTH       | `AO`   | `AO R` |
| FORCE       | `OA`   | `OW R` |
| CURE        | `UA`   | `UH R` |
| NEAR        | `IA`   | `IH R` |
| SQUARE      | `EA`   | `EH R` |

## Reduced Vowels

These are unstressed vowels that differ from the vowels in the main lexical sets.

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| HAPPY       | `IH`   | `IY`   |
| COMMA       | `AX`   | `AX`   |
| LETTER      | `AX`   | `AXR`  |

## Diphthongs

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| FACE        | `EY`   | `EY`   |
| PRICE       | `AY`   | `AY`   |
| CHOICE      | `OY`   | `OY`   |
| GOAT        | `OW`   | `OW`   |
| MOUTH       | `AW`   | `AW`   |

## Split Vowels

These are lexical sets defined by John Wells that are merged with other lexical
sets in both RP and GenAm, so have split from one of those lexical sets and
merged with the other.

| Lexical Set | RP     | GenAm  |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| BATH        | `AA`   | `AE`   |
| CLOTH       | `OH`   | `AO`   |
