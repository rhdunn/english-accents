This is a guide to transcribing the following English accents using the Arpabet
phoneme set used by the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary and other resources:

| Accent | Language Code   | Name                                   |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| GenAm  | `en-US-x-genam` | General American English               |
| IrE    | `en-IE`         | Irish English                          |
| RP     | `en-GB-x-rp`    | Received Pronunciation British English |
| ScE    | `en-scotland`   | Scottish English                       |

The vowel transcriptions use a classification system based on John Wells' Lexical
Sets. These were created by Wells in 1982 by comparing the RP and GenAm accents
in use at that time.

Where lexical sets have been merged in an accent you are transcribing but not
in one of the accents listed here, the transcription of the lexical set the two
have merged into should be used. For example, with a `NORTH-FORCE` merger, the
transcription for `NORTH` should be used, not the `FORCE` transcription.
