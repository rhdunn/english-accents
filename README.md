# English Accents

- [License](#license)

----------

This project is an investigation into the different accents of English. It's
aim is to accurately describe those accents such that pronunciation
dictionaries, text-to-speech voices and other computational linguistics
resources can be built on a common framework.

*  [Arpabet Transcriptions](docs/arpabet.md) - Describes how to transcribe
   different accents using the Arpabet-style phoneme transcription notation.
   Also includes a description of the lexical sets used to contrast and
   describe different accents.

## Accent Files

The following accent files define mappings between the Arpabet transcriptions
and broad IPA transcriptions that better represent the specified accent. These
files can be used across accents with different splits and mergers, where the
accents all share the same phonetic realisation of the Arpabet phonemes.

  *  [en-GB-x-rp](accents/en-GB-x-rp.csv) - Received Pronunciation (British English)
  *  [en-US-x-genam](accents/en-US-x-genam.csv) - General American English
